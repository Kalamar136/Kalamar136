# 🗺️ Hello, World!

I'm a **Software Engineering student** with a passion for learning and exploring the vast world of programming. I'm always eager to dive into new technologies and contribute to innovative projects. Whether it's building robust software solutions, automating tasks, or delving into low-level programming!

## 🔥 Featured Repositories

Here are some of the projects I've worked on individually and in teams:

- 🅿️🚗 **[Parking-Lot-Management-System](https://github.com/Kalamar136/Parking-Lot-Management-System)**: Parking Lot Website developed in a team of 6, using the Spring & Vue.js frameworks. Users can log-in as employees/manager/client and can book guest parking passes, make service appointments, or manage the parking lot.
  
- ♻️🤖 **[Garbage-Classification-AI-Model](https://github.com/Kalamar136/Garbage-Classification-AI-Model)**: Garbage classifier developed in a 3-person team using a pre-trained convolutional neural network model in Keras (Resnet50); it classifies a garbage image into one of 12 classes (paper, metal, glass, biological waste, etc.).

- 🏌️‍♂️⛳ **[Golf-Robot-Forge-McGill-2024](https://github.com/Kalamar136/Golf-Robot-Forge-McGill-2024)**: Robot that plays golf constructed in the context of a hardware hackathon (Forge McGill 2024). It can be driven using a left Joystick (in all directions), the Club can be charged with different levels of power to control the Golf ball's trajectory, and the front can also be used to ram the golf ball as a last resource for tight spots. The Hardware of the GCK was built using an Arduino Uno board, a bread board for the connections, 2x 2AA batteries for 2 motors (powering the wheels), a Servo motor, a Metal Car Structure, and a Coca Cola Can! For the software, it was programmed in Arduino with the Arduino IDE and used the Servo, and Joystick libraries.

- 🎯📖 **[CourseChamp](https://github.com/Kalamar136/CourseChamp)**: Have you ever been unsure about your next semester of university courses? ClassChamp is the one-stop-shop for all your course concerns. Every electrical, computer and software engineering course will have an individual page with the official course description, and associated ratings such as difficulty and tutorial helpfulness, tags, student reviews, a typical grade breakdown and grade breakdown by major. Developed in Spring & Vue.js frameworks.
  
- 🍿📽️ **[Choose-me-a-Movie-McHacks-9](https://github.com/Kalamar136/Choose-me-a-Movie-McHacks-9)**: Choose Me a Movie is a simple website developed in the context of a hackathon (McHacks 9th edition). This website helps you decide on a movie to watch through a series of questions hand-picked to ensure users' satisfaction. The movies are suggested from an online movie database. Developed in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

- 🎱 **[Roll-a-Ball](https://github.com/Kalamar136/Roll-a-Ball)**: Small video game developed individually in Unity with the help of the official Unity Tutorial.
